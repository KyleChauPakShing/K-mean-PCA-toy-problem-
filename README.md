# K-mean-and-PCA-toy-problem

In Ex1.py, we have created a small dataset with Sklearn so as to use it for implementing our PCA algorithm on our own.
In Ex2.py, we have tried our Diy PCA algorithm to some hand-written digit image stored in train0,train1 and train2 for dimensionality Reduction.
In Ex3.py, we create our own K-mean algorithm and test it on a small dataset generated by sklearn
In Ex4.py, we use the K-mean algorithm of Sklearn to find out how many cluster should we use for the hand-written digit image stored in t10k-images.idx1-ubyte and t10k-images.idx3-ubyte
